  # the story section
  story_title: The Story
  story_1: Our Background
  story_2: Most Viztercoin Contributors have thick, luscious beards. <strong>FACT.</strong></h3>
  story_3: <em>This gives us <strong>+10xp Chin Stroke</strong> abilities, and enhances our patience and diagnostic skills. <i class="far fa-smile"></i></em>
  story_4: The truth is, most of us are full-time developers on other projects, and this is our way to give back to the community with something fun.
  story_5: How we started it
  story_6: One chilly December night, RockSteady and Bebop were having a beer too many while discussing the madness around fake, flimsy ICOs with no product. Bebop surmised that it just wouldn't be possible to put out a real project nowadays without a serious team, doing serious marketing, and bringing in serious funding.
  story_7: RockSteady leaned in closely, stroked his beard intently, and had only one response..
  story_8: <strong>"Hold my beer."</strong>
  story_9: That night, December 9th, 2017, TurtleCoin was born.
  story_10: Why?
  story_11: Too many projects are bringing in <strong>too much funding</strong> despite most having <strong>no damn product</strong>. We figured, "why not do the whole thing in reverse? Start with a fun project, make it as simple and accessible as possible, and let it grow on its own."
  story_12: We have a strong belief in our no-funding strategy; if we make a cool product, <strong>the value will create itself</strong>. If you think we're wrong, we're happy to <a href="http://meta.turtlecoin.lol">talk</a> about it.
  story_13: A wise rat once said, "A turtle only moves forward by sticking his neck out.."

  # roadmap section
  roadmap_title: Roadmap
  roadmap_1: Hello Turtle
  roadmap_2: TurtleCoin was born <strong>December 9th, 2017</strong>.
  roadmap_3: In the beginning, we were command line only, compiled only for Linux, and got banned repeatedly from online forums for hosting flash TRTL giveaways.
  roadmap_4: GUI Wallets
  roadmap_5: "TurtleCoin Community has been hard at work to bring us a diverse graphical experience, as well as refreshing the command line wallet also. From day one, we've been committed to making TurtleCoin easier, and that starts with a good GUI. Take your pick of one of the following wallets:"
  roadmap_6: Market Partnerships
  roadmap_7: We pledged to have our TurtleCoins being publicly trading by Q2 2018, and we have accomplished that goal in several markets.
  roadmap_8: Development Started, Q2 2018
  roadmap_9: Mobius, Fast Blocks No Sync
  roadmap_10: A big headache with proof of work is syncing a huge chain, and fast blocks don't usually help that issue. Our goal is producing faster blocks on a shorter chain. This is perhaps the most aggressive goal, and will require the most help to complete.
  roadmap_11: TBA
  roadmap_12: Karai, Simple Smart Contracts
  roadmap_13: Distributed, trustless networks have uses beyond currency. Karai is our goal for enabling distributed applications and networks beyond the main blockchain.
  roadmap_14: Payment Integration Services
  roadmap_15: Fun, Fast, & Easy TurtleCoin Payment Integration Services For Developers, By Developers. Accepting TurtleCoin in your application is easier than ever.
  roadmap_16: Launched Q1 2019
